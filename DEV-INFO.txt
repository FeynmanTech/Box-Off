Write functions to calculate validity of moves

User interaction beyond moving cursor
     Space to select tiles
     Ctrl-N to do new game
     Menu bar (File:New|Save|Save As...|Open.../Help:Help...|About...)

File format auto-associated with program
     Possibly just 2 bytes for number of tiles (X and Y), followed by a series of 2's, 3's and 4's represnting different
      stone colors
     Most likely .BL - 'B'ox-Off 'L'ayout

Fortunately, it always seems to generate an even number of each color

===========================================================================================================================

Known Bugs:
Flickering on each update
     It may be possible to reduce flickering by only drawing tiles that actually changed appearance (usually just the 
      previous cursor position and the new cursor position)

Delay of each cursor move by one
     I.e. each time a key is pressed, it moves the cursor according to which hotkey was pressed before the most recent 
      press
     No known fix
